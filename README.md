# Zameen.com-Real-Estate-Data-Portal-Scraping-FastAPI-Streamlit-Database-

This project demonstrates large-scale web scraping, API development, and frontend integration:

Scraped real-estate data (~15,000+ entries available on the site).

Stored HTML snapshots of the first 3 pages for testing and scraped 100 pages (~1000 properties) to reduce load.

Designed the scraper to scale to the full dataset (15,000+ entries) if required.

Connected the scraped dataset with a relational database for persistence.

Built a FastAPI backend to expose property search endpoints.

Developed a Streamlit frontend to interactively explore and visualize property listings.

This pipeline showcases end-to-end data engineering workflow: scraping → storage → API → frontend.
